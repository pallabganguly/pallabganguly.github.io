## Union Budget: Aam aadmi Interpretation - Part II
February 21, 2021

In the last article we discussed about the various components that make up the budget, we talked about the revenue and expenditure of the Government of India that are covered in the budget. We also took a look at the debt situation and saw what the general trend was over the years.
In this concluding part, we will look at the specifics announced by the Finance Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, the allocations for various sectors and what it means for you and me, as non-economists. Before I start, I would like to tell you my inspiration for writing this series, [Prof. Satish Deodhar](https://faculty.iima.ac.in/~satish/) from the Indian Institute of Ahmedabad, whose book “Day-to-day Economics” covers whatever I have discussed in great details, and was a great reference point for some points in the previous article. 
Now let’s have a look at the Budget for FY22 (Remember a FY is named after the year it ends, so Budget FY22 is for the Fiscal Year April 2021 – March 2022).
The year 2020 was a watershed moment in the history of this country, having witnessed a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic that took world by storm. Economies all over the world shrunk, followed by what is hopefully a steady recovery. ![Contraction of GDP](https://www.businesstoday.in/story_image.jsp?img=/images/stories/Newstaffpics/505_010920041422.jpg&caption=) 

The Budget this year consists of six pillars as stated by Government of India:
1.  Health and Well Being
2.  Physical and Financial Capital Infrastructure
3.  Inclusive Development for Aspirational India
4.  Reinvigorating Human Capital
5.  Innovation and R&D
6.  Minimum Government, Maximum Governance

Now let’s have a look at each of this in a bit more detail. Note: All the below info is sourced from the Finance Ministers Budget speech, publicly available [here](https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/Budget_Speech.pdf):

1.  **Health and Well-being:** 
    - This assumes a lot of importance especially due to the global pandemic. The Finance Minister has announced that the allocated spending for the health sector will be Rupees 2.24L crores this year, up from last year’s Rupees 94k crores. This amount will go into institution building, as well as strengthening our healthcare network. Note that the Finance Minister has clearly said this is by no means an upper limit, she is willing to allocate more funds as and when the situation demands.
    - There has also been a major announcement, the “PM Atma Nirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana”. Under this scheme, a total of Rupees 64k crores will be disbursed over the next 6 years for the development of healthcare facilities.
    - Vaccine development: The Government has announced an allocation of Rupees 35k crores for development of vaccines (not just COVID vaccines). This will further solidify India’s position as a leading vaccine manufacturing nation.
    - A scheme called the “Poshan Mission” has been announced. This aims to improve the nutrition levels in the country especially the semi-urban and rural areas.
    - Clean air and Vehicle Scrapping: Air pollution is a major problem, especially in the cities, and the government is keen on reducing it, and they are also announcing an old vehicle scrapping policy. This will provide owners and option to voluntarily phase out old and unfit vehicles. More details of this scheme is yet to be shared.

2. **Physical and Financial Capital Infrastructure:**
    - Increase in Capital Expenditure: As we saw in part one, the Government is set to invest a total of Rupees 5.54L crore in capital expenditures, up from last year’s Rupees 4.1L crore. This should be good, as more capital infra spending means more jobs, better communication facilities, better roads, etc. to facilitate business. In fact, the National Infrastructure Pipeline which took up 6835 projects has now been boosted up to 7400 projects.
    - PLI (Production-Linked Incentive) Schemes: This aims to provide companies direct benefits when they set up plants and manufacture products and parts in India. You may have heard about Samsung no producing mobile phone screens in Noida, or about how India is a leading smartphone charger manufacturers, or Apple setting up shop in India. This is a really good scheme and could potentially turn India into a smartphone and electronic equipment manufacturing hub for the world. The Government has proposed to invest Rupees 1.97L crores over the next five years into the PLI schemes.
    - Railways get Rupees 1.1L crore: Out of this, Rupees 1.07L crore is for capital infrastructure development in various projects such as the Kochi Metro, creation of dedicated freight corridors (DFC) along KGP-BZA section, BSL-KGP sections.
    - Roadway projects: The government has proposed major road projects, totalling about 12,000 km of Roads for the (poll-bound) states of West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Assam.
    - Asset Monetisation: The government, as mentioned before plans to raise its NDCR, and one of the means of doing so is monetisation of assets such as the aforementioned DFC, NHAI toll roads, quite a few airports will also be monetised.
    - Yet another way of raising capital is through disinvestment of assets such as Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSE). Some of the CPSEs planned for disinvestment are Air India, BEML, Shipping Corporation of India, IDBI Bank, Pawan Hans. Moreover LIC is planned to go public with and IPO in FY22. As mentioned in the previous article, the government plans to raise Rupees 1.75L crores through disinvestments.
    - Textiles: India is already a large global textile hub, the Government plans to improve this situation by setting up Mega Investment Textile Parks to further facilitate exports. 7 such parks will be opened over the next 3 years.

3.  **Inclusive Development for Aspirational India:**
    - The Finance Minister touched upon how the Government has increased procurement in wheat, paddy, pulses, and cotton.
    - The Minister also maintained MSP would not be touched in light of these new Farm Bills, in fact the Government has increased number of mandis covered under e-NAM.
    - One Nation One Ration: The Government plans to roll out the One Nation, One Ration scheme, which is slated to benefit migrant labourers. This will enable a ration card holder to receive his ration in any state, in fact, one single member of a family can withdraw it in some state and other others can withdraw their rations in other states. This plan is currently in implementation phase.
    - Fishing sector: The government has also proposed to invest in new fishing harbours and sea-weed harvesting facilities
    - MSME’s: The government proposes to provide Rupees 15.7k crores for the MSMEs

4. **Re-invigorating Human Capital:**
    - School education: The Government has announced 100 new Sainik Schools to be set up in partnership with NGOs/private schools/States
    - Higher Education: Among other things, the government proposes to start a new university in Leh, Ladakh, setting up of a new Higher Education Commission for standard setting, accreditation, funding.
    - Skilling: An initiative is underway in partnership with UAE and Japan to benchmark skill, qualification. The partnership with Japan is of special mention as Japan’s quality in the technical areas is much needed in India. Government also intends to carry this forward with many other countries.

5.  **Innovation and R&D:**
    - National Research Foundation: Last year a National Research Foundation was announced and now the government intends to spend Rs. 50k crores into the NRF over the next 5 years.
    - There will be incentives to businesses to accept cashless and electronic payment modes, an allocation Rs. 1500 crores has been set for this.
    - National Language Translation Mission: This is a new initiative that will enable all Government policy related documents to be readily available in regional Indian languages digitally.

6. **Minimum Government, Maximum Governance:**
    - This has been one of the hallmarks of the BJP-led government over the last 6 or so years. Government is reducing its footprint in all but core areas. Continuing with this, the government talked about speedy justice in tribunals, bringing about fiscal transparency. The Minister also mentioned setting up conciliatory body to resolve disputes between contractors, investors, etc. On more interesting feature was the first ever digital census for India.


In addition to the six pillars, the Minister also outlines India’s Fiscal position, namely composition of debts, receipts, deficits. I have already covered that in my previous article, as I felt that it was necessary to show the financing and expenditures of the government before diving deep into the budget.

If you have made it all the way to the end, thanks a lot for reading, and I hope I will be able to come out with more interesting and informative articles. Until then, stay safe and goodbye!
