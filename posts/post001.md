## Taking the CAT: My experience
December 13, 2020

### CAT during COVID

This year the CAT was conducted by IIM Indore admist the loom of COVID, and they decided to conduct it in three slots rather then the usual two. Also the time per section was reduced to 40 mins, meaning we had a two-hour paper instead of the three that we have become accustomed to. These measures were taken to reduce the concentration of test-takers at the centres to minimise the chance of infections. Also, for the first time, we were allowed to take pens and watter bottles inside the hall, apart from masks, sanitizers, and gloves. There was no information on the number of questions, and it was not known until the Slot 1 fellows finished their paper.

### My slot and test centre

I was allotted Slot 3 at UEM in Rajarhat. I was relieved at getting the evening slot instead of the morning slot as it took me an hour and a half to get there, and had I got the morning slot, it would have been pretty difficult for me to stay fully awake and write the paper! The exam centre was pretty big but the spaces for each individual was rather small and cramped, but I imagine that was because they had to ensure all the people were separated well enough. All test-takers had their details verified and photographed as usual.

### The test
Now, onto the actual paper. There were 76 questions, 26 each from VARC and QA, 24 from DILR. Funnily enough, the instruction sheet before the paper mentioned that there would be 2 sets of 6 questions each, and 3 sets of 4 questions each in DILR, but did not mention anything else at all.

I found the VARC paper like 2019 CAT paper. Passages were not very interesting, but not tough, per se. The questions were a bit twisted and filled with double negatives.  Then there were passages that were outright difficult for the ordinary person to comprehend, not to mention they had twisted questions after them. But in hindsight, it was the same in ’19 too, so I guess I should have seen that coming. The VA questions were actually okay-ish, and I remember a few of the para-jumbles being totally doable, although some of the ‘authors opinion’ type questions were far too lengthy.

Moving on to DILR, I will not mince words, it was horrible for me. I used to be able to do 2 sets within 40 mins, and I expected to be able to do the same, but I managed only one, that too a four-question set. The six-a-set ones did seem tempting but they seemed too tough for me, although I did end up wasting a few minutes on the tree-question. I was skipping through sets to find a comfortable one and reached the end of the paper and still couldn't find one. It did feel tougher than the previous year's DILR but then again CAT has been one-upping DILR difficulty for some years now.

Quant was actually doable, some of the questions were genuinely enjoyable, laid focus on concepts rather than formulae. However as was pointed out later, the reduction of time and the reduction of the number of questions was not exactly in proportion, and the level of difficulty was the same as in earlier years, so I did feel a bit of a time crunch. Plus the devastation of DILR played a negative role for me personally.

Overall, I was far from satisfied from my performance in the paper, but despite all the ranting online about how the paper was substantially difficult, or how Slot 3 guys got hit the hardest, I feel the test was conducted well in these challenging times. Lets see what the results look like!
