## Elon Musk and MBAs: My two cents
December 30, 2020

In a recent interview to the Wall Street Journal, Tesla CEO Elon Musk decried what he has called the ‘MBA’-ization of corporate America. He has stressed on the need for business executives to focus on products and customer satisfaction rather than financials and spreadsheets. While this has predictably dawn criticism from deans of leading business schools across America, it would nevertheless benefit us to introspect on the matter.

Mr Musk has alleged that MBA graduated should pay attention to the ground realities of the business and try to improve products and customer experiences, instead of attending board meetings and evaluating company finances. However, these two need not be independent of each other. One can build and improve products and services and also rely on conventional business practices such as board meetings and financial reviews. Indeed, one might even say that the information from such practices, combined with the knowledge that an MBA provides contribute to the improvement of products Mr. Musk has referred to. 

Moreover, most business schools today strive to impart a holistic business education covering several aspects including improvement of products and services, societal and economic costs and benefits, legal and ethical aspects, all of which are not just beneficial but essential to a company. Of course, one may argue that all of these can be learnt outside of an MBA too. However, the right academic setting, structure, rigour tend to be better at imparting these valuable skills. Infact, many of the top executives of major companies hold an MBA from respected institution, including Tim Cook of Apple, Doug McMillan of Walmart, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, to quote a few.

Another area Mr. Musk has touched upon is that of innovation and entrepreneurship. It may be pointed out that many of the major b-schools in the US and India do have centres for entrepreneurship, and the acumen of the faculty certainly helps guide a relative newcomer to the business world. Many MBAs have gone one to start and lead their own enterprises, such as Falguni Nayar of Nyka (an Indian cosmetics brand), who is an IIM Ahmedabad graduate. The holistic knowledge mentioned previously is also an important factor to lead and succeed in the industry.

Therefore, we see that Mr Musk’s statements, while not totally unjustified, can be seen in a positive light. In particular, feedback from many titans of the industry such as Mr. Musk himself is taken into account to improve the curriculum and content of leading b-schools. This, in turn produces better managers and leaders, and is therefore beneficial to all.
