### Who am I

I am a Software Developer working at Oracle in Hyderabad, India. I work on the Oracle Fusion suite of apps, with Java, and Oracle databases. I have previously worked for Tata Consultancy Services, where I was a developer in an order management system for a major British retailer.
I am a Computer Science & Engineering graduate from Kalyani Government Engineering College, West Bengal.

### What I am interested in

While I have experience of working as a developer in software/IT companies, I am interested in general management and consulting. The clockworks of businesses excite me, I like to read interesing cases of how companies run themselves, and I like spending time thinking how and what they could do better with the (very) limited knowledge that I possess.

### What I'm doing when I'm not working

Reading articles from prominent journals/magazines like HBR, listening to music, and trying out the parts I like the most on a guitar. I also enjoy a good novel and the occasional movie.
