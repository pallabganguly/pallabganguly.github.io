### New post on blog **[Union Budget: Aam aadmi Interpretation - Part II](../blog)**

### Who am I

I like to think of myself as a problem solver. Although growing up I created more problems than I solved, I did enjoy Maths and Physics and people told me to become an engineer because 'thats what all the smart chaps do'. Now interestingly, Engineering is great if you're someone who think of themselves as a problem solver, and I was rather lucky I listened to those people who nudged me into engineering becasue I enjoyed my course thoroughly (okay, maybe Computer Architecture wasnt that fun). I graduated in Computer Science & Engineering from Kalyani Government Engineering College, West Bengal in 2018.
I am a currently Software Developer working at Oracle in Hyderabad, India. I work on the Oracle Fusion suite of apps, with Java, and Oracle databases. I have previously worked for Tata Consultancy Services, where I was a developer in an order management system for a major British retailer.

### What I am interested in

While I have experience of working as a developer in software/IT companies, I am interested in management consulting. The clockworks of businesses excite me, I like to read interesing cases of how companies run, and I like spending time thinking how and what they could do better with the limited knowledge that I possess. While working for my former employer, I got to participate and witness how business decisions and strategies make their way from the drawing board to the real world (or in our case, the stores and warehouse). I was interested in how we measured our performance, how we identified problems in our way of doing things, and how we were going to resolve them. It was interesting to understand how solutions were thought of and implemented to run a business and what role technology played in that. I intend to be able to join a firm where I can similarly be a part of a group that advise businesses.

### What I'm doing when I'm not working

I spend most of my free time reading, be it the news, or magazines, or even Wikipedia articles about events and persons that I admire. I am a big fan of Agatha Christie's works, and I am currently reading her Tommy and Tuppence series of novels. I also like listening to music (Rock and Blues are my favourite genres, and I swear by Cream and Zeppelin), and every now and then I watch the occassional movie. I am also a big history buff, especially European and Indian history.
